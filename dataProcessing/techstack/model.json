    Details: 'Waymo is conducting extensive on-road testing of our self-driving Pacifica minivans on the streets of the Phoenix metropolitan area. This testing ranges from hardware validation with only Waymo-trained operators onboard to providing paid ride-hailing trips in fully driverless cars (with no operators onboard) to Arizonans who have volunteered to be part of our Early Rider Program.\r\n' +
      'On-road testing is a critical step in the development of our self-driving system. It allows us to validate the skills we have developed, uncover new challenging situations, and develop new capabilities. Real-world testing provides a continuous feedback loop that lets us refine our system continually. Our engineers observe real-world situations, make adjustments to the software to refine our driving, and then implement those changes. This iterative approach to testing and public-road validation helps us safely scale our capabilities as we expand our operational design domain and the capabilities of our vehicles.',
